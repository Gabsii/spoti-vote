# Project Description:

The idea for this project resulted as we have a Spotify class playlist with great songs we listen to in our breaks.
The problem with it was that Spotify's shuffling feature didn't please the majority of the class.
To solve this problem I thought about creating a website where users could choose between four to eight songs (depending on the settings). The song with the most votes would be added to the queue as next song.

## Requirements:
* [Node v6.0 and higher](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Spotify Account](https://www.spotify.com/at/)

## Usage

To use my webpage, you first want to download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Then clone my repository using:\
`git clone https://github.com/Gabsii/spoti-vote.git`

After successfully cloning the repository, you want to startup a commandline in its folder and run:\
\
`cd spoti-vote`\
`npm install`\
`npm start` \
\
Congratulations! You now are able to use my webpage.
