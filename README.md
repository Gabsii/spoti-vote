# Project Description:

The idea for this project resulted as we have a spotify class playlist with songs we listen to in our breaks.  
The problem with it was, that the shuffling Spotify did wouldn't make anyone happy.  
To solve this problem I thought about inventing a Website where users could choose between four to eight songs (depending on settings). The song with the most votes would be added to the queue as next song.

## Requirements:
* [Node v6.0 and higher](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Spotify Account](https://www.spotify.com/at/)

## Usage

To use my webpage, you want to first download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Then clone my repository using:
`git clone https://github.com/Gabsii/spoti-vote.git`

After you successfully cloned my repository, you want to startup **cmd** in this folder and run:

`npm start`

Congratulations! You now are able to see my webpage.
